# The Local Sports Club üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Local Sports Club is an application that helps you create and participate to amateur sports events around you. It's been especially built for people new to a city and for the ones who want to meet people around their favourite sports activities.
<br><br>
The idea is simple: either browse for existing events and freely join one if there's a spot left, or create a new event yourself and wait for people to join. You can communicate with others right in the event page to talk about the details of the event.
<br><br>
The Local Sports Club was our final project at Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp. It has been built with Ruby on Rails and is live at www.thelocalsportsclub.com.
